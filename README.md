## Features

- Automated installation of your favorite software and tools
- Customizable configuration file to tailor the setup to your needs
- No external dependencies

## Usage

Modify CASKS, FORMULAE & NPMPACKAGES in the install.sh file to select the software you want to install.
Run the install.sh script in your terminal:

```
./install.sh
```

## Acknowledgements

This setup for configuration is too personal and not flexible enough.
Especially the dock settings and the system settings.
It is what i need for my MBP M1.

### To do:

- Create universal config file
- Create brewfile instead?
- Change prompts - they are too random now.
- Game dev package, web dev package etc as prompts instead?

### Feature ideas:

- Checklist (TUI)
- ASCII Graphics over install
- VSCode, Transmission settings etc
- Log out of FaceTime/Messages
